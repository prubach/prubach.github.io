## About / Bio

In 2010 I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science, in particular in the domain of Distributed Computing, from the Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology. My dissertation entitled “Optimal Resource Allocation in Metacomputing Environments” (available [here](link-to-dissertation)) was a result of a tight cooperation with Dr. Michael Sobolewski on his SORCER project. This cooperation started in 2008 when I was as a Fulbright Visiting Scholar at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas.

I earned an M.Sc. degree in 2003 from the Warsaw School of Economics, specializing in Information Systems and Applied Computer Science. During my studies I worked on practical IT projects including systems for online shops, the scouting association, and one of the largest Catholic parishes in Warsaw.

I have both an economic and technological background. In my professional career I worked as a systems administrator, application architect, systems analyst, project manager and IT architect in organizations ranging from small IT solution providers to large corporations such as PKO BP S.A. and Telekomunikacja Polska. I spent 5 years at Telekomunikacja Polska S.A. Research & Development (Orange Labs) as IT Architect in two EU projects: [SUPER](http://www.ip-super.org) and [SPICE](http://www.ist-spice.org).

Currently I work as an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Information Systems and Digital Economy, Warsaw School of Economics, and simultaneously serve as President & CEO of Sorcersoft.com S.A. — provider of a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization platform based on the open-source SORCER project.
